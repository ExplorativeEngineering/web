          <p>This is a summary of the work I have been engaged in while
            working at the <em>Architectural Dynamics in Living Cells
              Program</em> (now part of the <em>Cellular Dynamics
              Program</em>) at MBL from 2002 until 2015. &nbsp;The lab
            engages in interdisciplinary collaborations to conduct
            research in physical optics for the interpretation of image
            content and of computational methods for image enhancement
            and restoration.&nbsp; These physical and engineering
            projects are stimulated and guided by biological inquiries
            into the structural basis of cell function.</p>
          <p>In particular, I have been involved in the development of
            software systems for birefringence imaging of live cells
            using polarized light microscopy.&nbsp; I work primarily for
            <a
              href="http://www.mbl.edu/bell/current-faculty/oldenbourg-lab/"><strong>Dr.



                Rudolf Oldenbourg</strong>,</a> while also assisting <a

              Dr. <strong>Shinya Inoué</strong></a> and <a

                Michael Shribak</strong></a>.&nbsp; My work has involved
            software design &amp; development, microscopy and optics,

          <h2>Software Design &amp; Development</h2>
          <p>I have performed all aspects of software systems design and
            development in the Lab, including testing, debugging,
            documentation and support.</p>
          <p>I have primarily used <em>Java</em> in the programming of
            various projects since 2001.&nbsp; I have mastered many
            aspects of this object-oriented programming language,
            including concurrency / multi-threading, polymorphism,
            generics,&nbsp; annotations, etc.&nbsp; I have extensively
            incorporated open source libraries in the construction of
            systems and components.&nbsp; I have used the <em>Java
              Native Interface</em> to utilize third-party libraries for
            hardware control and data interfacing.&nbsp; This requires
            the design of&nbsp; C/C++ wrappers, which I have built for
            cameras and an X-Y stage controller.&nbsp; I use the <em>Netbeans




            </em>integrated development environment, as well as other
            development tools including ANT, SWIG, etc.&nbsp; I have
            also utilized other programming languages, including C++,
            C#, and&nbsp; Python.</p>
